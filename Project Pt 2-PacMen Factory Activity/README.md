# Pacman Factory Project

This project used the same array of four images of Pacman as the Pacman Project, but instead of just programming a single Pacman to move left & right in a straight line, this program created multiple Pacmen to glide and bounce around the screen. Multiple Pacmen can be generated each with separate velocities & positions, and they will bounce on the sides of the screen for the duration the program is running.
