# Creating Sentences Activity

This activity, through Javascript, takes a string array of individual words and converts it into a single string value of a sentence. Using a function, the individual words in the array are added into an initially empty sentence string, and once the function cycles through every single word in the array, the cosole will output the complete sentence.
