# Debugging Assignment

The debugging assignment has 4 scripts attached to one HTML file. The HTML file has four buttons that act as checkpoints, and the four scripts are linked with their respective buttons. Each script is intentionally bugged so that the process of debugging can be practices, and a debugging is successful when the button is clicked, and it confirms that the Javascript script has been fixed. As per the assignment, only the first three scripts of the four were actually debugged.
