# Fortune Teller Activity

The goal of this assignment is to create a fortune teller game that gives you a fortune depending on the numeric value of a fortune variable. That value can range from 0 - 10, and your fortune is determined to be low if the value is between 0-3, average if the value is between 4-7, and high if the value is between 8-10. Values beyond the 0 - 10 range will result in the program alerting the user that it's unable to read the fortune.
