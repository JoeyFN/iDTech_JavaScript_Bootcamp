# Pacman Project

This project involved using four Pacman sprites in order to create a small animation of Pacman moving left and right on the screen in a straight line with its mouth constantly opening and closing just like the actual game Pacman. Once Pacman reaches the rightmost point of the screen, it switches directions and goes left until reaching the leftmost point of the screen where it switches once again and goes right. This repeats for the entire duration of the program's running.
